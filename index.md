## 📂 Featured Projects

### 📦 Inside Olist: Review Score Impact Analysis
*Uncovering the hidden drivers of customer satisfaction in e-commerce.*

- **The Problem:** Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce giant, faced fluctuating customer review scores. The goal was to identify exactly *what* drives a poor rating using their massive dataset.
- **The Solution:** Conducted a deep exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical review of order statuses, freight performance, and review comments.
- **Key Insight:** **Speed > Punctuality.** Data revealed that faster absolute delivery times correlate strongly with higher ratings, even if the order was technically "late" per the estimate. Customers value speed more than deadline accuracy.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Feature Engineering, Statistics, Seaborn.

### 🎓 Student Retention Intelligence (OULAD)
*Predicting student dropout risk before it happens using interaction logs.*

- **The Problem:** Online courses often suffer from high dropout rates. The challenge was to detect *at-risk* students early enough to intervene, rather than analyzing failure after the fact.
- **The Solution:** Built a Machine Learning classifier using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset. I analyzed clickstream data (VLE interactions) combined with demographic info to model student behavior.
- **Key Insight:** **Engagement > Demographics.** The model revealed that a student's interaction with course material in the first 2 weeks is a stronger predictor of retention than their previous education or background.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Random Forest, Pandas, Matplotlib.

### 🏥 Synthea Patient Health Analysis
*Simulating and predicting heart disease risks using synthetic medical records.*

- **The Problem:** Real-world medical data is scarce due to privacy laws. The goal was to build a robust disease prediction model using high-fidelity synthetic patient history (Synthea) to identify key risk factors for heart disease.
- **The Solution:** Performed extensive data cleaning on patient encounter logs and vital signs. Trained a classification model to predict the likelihood of cardiac events based on lifestyle metrics.
- **Key Insight:** **Lifestyle Multipliers.** The analysis quantified how specific combinations (e.g., High BMI + Smoker) exponentially increased risk scores compared to individual factors alone, enabling more targeted risk stratification.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-learn, Seaborn, Healthcare Analytics.
